## üî≠ What I'm haved worked on
My team and I have worked on impactful projects that combine advanced AI with practical applications:
- [**AI Video Call Application**]([https://github.com/Evolutioned-Organisation/Video-Call-AI-ANU](https://baekcheolkim.github.io/docs/2portfolio/2video-call-AI-application-project.html)):  
  A multi-channel video communication platform enhanced with **emotion detection** and **diarization prompts**.  
  This project leverages **GPT-powered NLP models** and **cloud-based scalability** with MLOps pipelines.

- [**Privacy-Aware Perception System for Robotics**](#):
  (https://baekcheolkim.github.io/docs/2portfolio/3Privacy-Aware-Perception-System-for-Robotics.html)  

  We propose an **End-to-End Human-Head Localisation via Body-Only Detection** model
